---

## ACT I: THREE EVENINGS
*Establishing normalcy, planting seeds of wrongness*

---

### NIGHT ONE — "The Good Day"

**Scene:** Protagonist arrives home from work, exhausted. The house is warm. Sibling is in the living room, wrapped in a blanket, watching something on TV.

The sibling seems okay tonight—tired, but present. They talk about small things. The sibling mentions they found an online support group for people with chronic illness. "It's nice to talk to people who get it."

**CHOICE 1:** How do you respond to the support group news?
- A) "That's great! I'm glad you found people to talk to."
- B) "What kind of group? What do they talk about?"
- C) "Just be careful with online stuff. Lots of weirdos out there."

*Each choice affects the sibling's openness in future conversations and how much they reveal.*

**CHOICE 2:** Before bed, the sibling asks if you want to watch a movie together. You have work early tomorrow.
- A) Stay and watch the movie. (Strengthens bond, protagonist notices sibling scratching at their wrist absently)
- B) Apologize and go to bed. (Sibling says "It's okay. I understand." — guilt builds)
- C) Offer to watch something short. (Compromise — brief scene, sibling seems distracted)

---

### NIGHT TWO — "The Shift"

**Scene:** One week later. Protagonist comes home. The house feels different. There's incense burning—something earthy and unfamiliar. The sibling is sitting in the dark, cross-legged on the floor.

The sibling is more energetic than they've been in months. They talk about "acceptance" and how the group has taught them to "stop fighting what's coming." They're wearing a new pendant—a simple circle with a vertical line through it.

**CHOICE 3:** Ask about the pendant?
- A) "That's new. Where'd you get it?"
- B) Say nothing. (Observe silently—internal monologue notes it)
- C) "Is that from your group?"

*Asking directly causes sibling to become slightly defensive: "It's just a symbol. It helps me focus."*

**CHOICE 4:** The sibling says the group has been talking about "what's underneath." When you ask what that means, they smile and say "You wouldn't understand yet."
- A) Press harder. "Try me. What are they telling you?"
- B) Let it go. They seem happy, and that's rare.
- C) Express concern. "This is starting to sound weird. Are you okay?"

**CHOICE 5:** That night, you hear the sibling moving around upstairs at 3 AM. The footsteps stop near the water heater closet.
- A) Get up and check on them.
- B) Call out from bed, asking if they're okay.
- C) Stay in bed. It's probably nothing.

*If player investigates: The hallway is empty. The sibling's door is closed. A faint draft comes from somewhere you can't identify.*

---

### NIGHT THREE — "The Last Conversation"

**Scene:** Protagonist comes home. The sibling is sitting at the kitchen table, hands folded, waiting. They look peaceful—too peaceful. The house is silent. No TV, no music.

The sibling says they need to tell you something. They've been chosen. The Threshold Assembly has shown them "what waits below" and they're not afraid anymore. "The illness isn't punishment. It's preparation."

**CHOICE 6:** How do you react?
- A) Anger. "This is insane. You're in a cult."
- B) Fear. "You're scaring me. Please, just talk to me."
- C) Bargaining. "Let's see another doctor. A specialist. Please."
- D) Silence. (Just listen.)

**CHOICE 7:** The sibling reaches across the table and takes your hand. Their skin is cold. They say: "When I'm gone, don't look for me. But if you do—" They stop. "Never mind."
- A) "If I do, what? Finish the sentence."
- B) "You're not going anywhere."
- C) "I'm calling someone. A doctor. This isn't right."

*If pressed, sibling says: "If you do... follow the warm air." Then they change the subject.*

**CHOICE 8:** Before you go to bed, you notice the sibling has put up a large woven tapestry near the water heater closet upstairs. They say it's for "energy flow."
- A) Examine it closely. (You notice it's covering more wall than necessary)
- B) Accept the explanation.
- C) "This is getting out of hand. What are you hiding?"

---

## ACT II: THE DISAPPEARANCE
*Loss, investigation, grief, and the first signs*

---

### NIGHT FOUR — "Gone"

**Scene:** The protagonist comes home. The house is dark. Silent. The sibling is not in any of their usual spots.

**CHOICE 9:** Initial search of the house.
- A) Check their bedroom first.
- B) Check the bathroom (fear of self-harm).
- C) Go straight to the backyard.

*Wherever you check, they're not there. Signs of their presence—medication, phone, shoes—are still in the house.*

**CHOICE 10:** After 30 minutes of searching and calling their phone:
- A) Call 911 immediately.
- B) Call Elena, the former caretaker, first.
- C) Drive around the neighborhood looking.

---

### THE SEARCH — Two Weeks

**Montage sequence:** Police interviews. Search parties. Flyers. Detective Marsh is kind but increasingly pessimistic. The Threshold Assembly is investigated but turns up nothing—just a defunct website and a P.O. box that leads nowhere.

**CHOICE 11:** Detective Marsh asks about the sibling's mental state.
- A) Be fully honest about the cult, the strange behavior, everything.
- B) Downplay it. "They were sick, but not crazy."
- C) Withhold the specific details about the pendant and "what's underneath."

**CHOICE 12:** Elena reaches out, says she noticed the sibling had been "drawing something" obsessively in the weeks before you came home each night.
- A) Ask her to describe the drawings.
- B) Ask if she still has any of them.
- C) Ask if the sibling ever mentioned the Threshold Assembly to her.

*Elena reveals: The drawings were of tunnels. Concentric circles going down. And something at the bottom—she couldn't tell what.*

---

### THE FUNERAL

**Scene:** Two weeks pass. No body is found. The sibling is declared dead. A small funeral is held. The casket is empty.

**CHOICE 13:** At the funeral, a stranger approaches you. Well-dressed. They offer condolences and say: "Morgan spoke very highly of you. They wanted you to have this." They hand you an envelope.
- A) Take it and open it immediately.
- B) Take it but wait until later.
- C) Refuse it. "Who the hell are you?"

*The envelope contains a single piece of paper with a hand-drawn map of your house's second floor. An X marks the water heater closet. On the back: "THE DOOR OPENS FROM INSIDE."*

**CHOICE 14:** After the funeral:
- A) Show the map to Detective Marsh.
- B) Keep it to yourself.
- C) Burn it.

---

## ACT III: THE HAUNTED MONTHS
*Grief, strange occurrences, building toward discovery*

---

### THREE MONTHS LATER

**Scene:** The protagonist has been living in a fog. Working. Coming home to an empty house. Not sleeping well.

**CHOICE 15:** How have you been coping?
- A) Drinking. The nights are easier with something to blur them.
- B) Working obsessively. Filling every hour.
- C) Going through the sibling's things, piece by piece, looking for answers.
- D) Avoiding the house entirely. Staying late at work, sleeping on the couch.

*This choice affects the protagonist's mental state and available options later.*

---

### THE WRONGNESS BEGINS

Strange things start happening:

**Event 1:** You wake up at 3:17 AM to rhythmic sounds from upstairs. Not footsteps. Something like... knocking. From inside the walls.

**CHOICE 16:** Response to the knocking:
- A) Investigate immediately.
- B) Pull the covers over your head. You're imagining it.
- C) Record it on your phone.

*If recorded: Playing it back, the knocking sounds almost like a pattern. Like morse code. You don't know morse code.*

**Event 2:** Objects in the sibling's room have moved. The pendant—you kept it after the funeral—is no longer in the drawer where you left it. It's on the nightstand. Facing the door.

**CHOICE 17:** The pendant:
- A) Throw it away.
- B) Put it back in the drawer and lock it.
- C) Wear it. Feel closer to them.
- D) Research the symbol.

*If researched: The symbol predates the Threshold Assembly. It appears in occult texts dating back centuries. It represents "the threshold between above and below."*

**Event 3:** You're doing laundry when you notice something: there's warm air coming from the upstairs hallway. The tapestry the sibling hung is moving slightly, like there's a draft behind it.

**CHOICE 18:** The tapestry:
- A) Tear it down immediately.
- B) Look behind it carefully.
- C) Leave it. You're not ready.

---

### THE DISCOVERY

**Scene:** Whether through investigation or necessity (the water heater breaks, a leak, something forces you there), the protagonist removes the tapestry and finds: a seam in the wall. A door that shouldn't exist.

**CHOICE 19:** The door is slightly ajar. Warm, stale air seeps through. You hear... something. Maybe just air moving. Maybe breathing.
- A) Open the door.
- B) Call Detective Marsh first.
- C) Call Elena.
- D) Get a weapon first.

**CHOICE 20:** Beyond the door is a narrow passage. It doesn't go to the water heater. It goes *down*—a spiral staircase carved from stone, far older than the house.
- A) Descend immediately.
- B) Go back. Prepare. Return tomorrow.
- C) Seal the door and try to forget.

*If the player tries to seal it and forget: That night, you wake up standing at the open door. You don't remember getting out of bed.*

---

## ACT IV: THE DESCENT
*Exploring the tunnels, discovering the truth*

---

### THE FIRST LEVEL — The Antechamber

**Scene:** The stone stairs spiral down for what feels like too long. The walls are covered in symbols—the same symbol from the pendant, repeated hundreds of times. Some are carved. Some are drawn in something dark.

The stairs open into a chamber. There are belongings here. Sleeping bags. Empty water bottles. Journals. This was a meeting place.

**CHOICE 21:** Explore the chamber:
- A) Read the journals.
- B) Search for another exit.
- C) Call out. See if anyone responds.

*The journals are disturbing. Entries from dozens of people. All talking about "the descent." All ending mid-sentence or with: "I'M READY."*

**CHOICE 22:** You find your sibling's handwriting in one of the journals. The last entry reads: "They're wrong about one thing. It's not about dying. It's about going deeper. The lowest point is where you become."
- A) Take the journal with you.
- B) Leave it. You don't want it.
- C) Read more entries, looking for clues.

---

### THE SECOND LEVEL — The Residences

**Scene:** A tunnel leads from the antechamber, sloping further down. It opens into something that looks almost like a neighborhood—small alcoves carved into the walls, some with personal effects. Beds. Photos. Someone *lived* here.

**CHOICE 23:** One of the alcoves has a lantern still burning. The bed is unmade. Someone was here recently.
- A) Wait and watch.
- B) Search the alcove.
- C) Call out.
- D) Move past quickly.

*If you wait: You hear shuffling deeper in the tunnel. Something moving away from you. Not toward.*

**CHOICE 24:** You find photographs pinned to a wall. One of them shows your sibling. They're standing with a group of people in robes. They're smiling. Behind them is a massive dark opening—a pit.
- A) Take the photograph.
- B) Look for faces you recognize.
- C) Keep moving. You need to find them.

---

### THE THIRD LEVEL — The Cathedral

**Scene:** The tunnel opens into a vast cavern. The ceiling is so high your flashlight can't reach it. In the center is a stone structure—an altar of some kind. Candles have been burned down to nothing here. Thousands of them.

**CHOICE 25:** On the altar is a book. Handwritten. The title page reads: "THE RITES OF THRESHOLD."
- A) Read the book.
- B) Destroy it.
- C) Leave it and continue deeper.

*The book describes a ritual. A "willing descent." The faithful go down, and down, and down, until they reach "the lowest place." There, they "shed the body's failure" and "become one with what waits."*

**CHOICE 26:** Behind the altar, there's a hole in the floor. A pit. The warm air is coming from down there. You can see the first rungs of a ladder.
- A) Climb down.
- B) Drop something and listen for it to hit bottom.
- C) Call your sibling's name into the pit.

*If you call their name: Silence. Then, from very far below, something that might be an echo. Or might be a response.*

---

### THE FOURTH LEVEL — The Warren

**Scene:** The ladder goes down for a long time. Your arms ache. The walls close in—this is a shaft, barely wide enough for one person.

You emerge into a warren of tunnels. They branch in every direction. The walls are wet. The air is thick and warm.

**CHOICE 27:** Navigation:
- A) Mark your path as you go (tear cloth, scratch walls).
- B) Follow the warmest air current.
- C) Follow the faint sound you keep almost hearing.
- D) Trust your instincts and move randomly.

*The sound, if followed, is a voice. Humming. A melody the sibling used to hum when they were tired.*

---

## ACT V: THE REUNION
*The ending, the confrontation, the choice*

---

### THE LOWEST PLACE

**Scene:** You emerge into a chamber. The floor is soft—not stone. Something organic. The warmth is oppressive. In the center of the room, sitting with their back to you, is a figure.

They're wearing the sibling's clothes.

**CHOICE 28:** Approach:
- A) Say their name.
- B) Approach silently.
- C) Stay at the entrance. Don't go closer.

---

### THE FIGURE TURNS

**Scene:** The figure turns. It is your sibling—but *wrong*. Their face is theirs, but the proportions have shifted. Their eyes are too calm. Their smile is too wide. They don't breathe.

"You came. I wasn't sure you would."

**CHOICE 29:** The conversation:
- A) "What happened to you?"
- B) "I'm here to take you home."
- C) "What is this place?"
- D) "Are you... alive?"

The sibling explains: The illness was always going to take them. The Assembly showed them another way. They went down, and down, and down. And at the bottom, they found something that *wanted* them. They're not sick anymore. They're not dying. They're not even really *them* anymore. But they remember you. They still love you.

"You could stay. You don't have to be afraid. You don't have to be alone."

---

### THE FINAL CHOICE

**CHOICE 30:** The sibling extends a hand. Behind them, the darkness seems to pulse. You can feel something watching. Waiting. The way back is still open—for now.

- **A) Take their hand.** (You stay. You descend. You become. The house above is eventually sold. No one ever finds out what's beneath it. Until the next person moves in.)

- **B) Refuse and flee.** (You run. The tunnels seem to shift, but you marked your path. You emerge, gasping, into your own hallway. You seal the door. You sell the house. You never speak of it. But some nights, you swear you feel warm air on the back of your neck.)

- **C) Try to pull them out by force.** (A struggle. The sibling doesn't fight back—they just look sad. "You can't save me. I'm not lost." The darkness shifts. You realize you are very, very small here. You barely make it out. The sibling doesn't follow. The door seals itself behind you.)

- **D) Ask to understand.** (The sibling takes your hand—but doesn't pull. They show you. A flash of vision: the thing beneath, vast and patient. The faithful, absorbed into something larger. Not dead. Not alive. *Part* of something. You wake up at the base of the ladder, alone. The sibling is gone. The chamber is empty. Was any of it real? The pendant around your neck says yes.)

---

## ENDINGS SUMMARY

**Ending A — "Communion"**
The protagonist joins their sibling. Bittersweet, horrifying, but together.

**Ending B — "Escape"**
The protagonist survives but is forever changed. The sibling is lost.

**Ending C — "Defiance"**
The protagonist tries to save what can't be saved. Survives through will, not wisdom.

**Ending D — "Understanding"**
The protagonist glimpses the truth and must live with it. Ambiguous. Haunted.

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Thematic Elements
- **Guilt and helplessness:** Watching someone you love deteriorate and being unable to stop it.
- **The seduction of certainty:** Cults offer answers when life offers only questions.
- **What we bury beneath us:** Houses as metaphors for the self; basements/tunnels as the subconscious.
- **Love after transformation:** Can you still love someone if they're no longer who they were?

### Gameplay Considerations
- Choices should have *weight*—both narratively and mechanically. The protagonist's mental state, relationships, and knowledge should shift based on decisions.
- Some choices are false—the protagonist is being drawn toward the discovery regardless. But *how* they get there matters.
- The sibling should never feel like a villain. They were desperate and found something that offered relief.

### Mystery Threads to Maintain
- What IS the thing below? Never fully explained.
- Who was the stranger at the funeral? Never confirmed.
- How old are the tunnels? Why are they under THIS house?
- Were there others? What happened to them?
