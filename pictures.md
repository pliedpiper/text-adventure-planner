## ACT I: THREE EVENINGS

### Scene 1 - Night One: The Living Room [x]
**File:** `living_room_warm.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A dimly lit living room at night. A figure wrapped in a blanket sits on a worn couch, face obscured by pixelation, illuminated by the cold blue glow of a television screen. Warm lamplight from the corner creates a false sense of comfort. The room feels small and safe - but something in the shadows of the doorway suggests this won't last. Vintage wallpaper. Heavy curtains drawn. Medicine bottles barely visible on an end table.

---

### Scene 2 - Night Two: The Shift [x]
**File:** `incense_dark.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. The same living room but wrong. Complete darkness except for the orange ember glow of burning incense. A silhouetted figure sits cross-legged on the floor, facing away from camera, face not visible. Wisps of smoke curl upward, pixelated into geometric patterns. A pendant around their neck catches impossible light - a circle with a vertical line through it (the threshold symbol). The TV is off. The warmth is gone. Dreamlike and unsettling atmosphere.

---

### Scene 3 - Night Three: The Kitchen Table [x]
**File:** `kitchen_table_waiting.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A sparse kitchen at night. Overhead fluorescent light casting harsh, sickly green illumination. A figure sits at a small table, hands folded, facing the viewer. Their face is too calm, too peaceful - features blurred into unsettling serenity, obscured by pixelation. Empty chairs. The table is bare except for their folded hands. Through the doorway behind them, a dark hallway stretches back. The composition feels like an interrogation or a confession.

---

### Scene 4 - Night Three: The Tapestry [x]
**File:** `tapestry_hallway.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A narrow upstairs hallway in a suburban house. A large woven tapestry hangs on the wall, ornate with geometric patterns that seem to shift in the pixelation. The tapestry covers more wall than it should - the edges don't quite align with the architecture. Warm air seems to emanate from behind it, suggested by subtle heat distortion. A water heater closet door is nearby, mundane, unassuming. Low resolution makes the tapestry's pattern almost impossible to focus on. Liminal space atmosphere.

---

## ACT II: THE DISAPPEARANCE

### Scene 5 - Night Four: Gone [x]
**File:** `empty_house_dark.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A house interior in complete darkness. Only moonlight through windows creates silver rectangles on floors. Every room feels abandoned. Shoes by the door. A phone on the counter, screen dark. A protagonist's shadow stretches long across the floor as they search. The emptiness is oppressive. No other figure anywhere. Just absence. Analog horror ARG screenshot aesthetic.

---

### Scene 7 - The Funeral: Empty Casket [x]
**File:** `funeral_empty.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A small church or funeral home interior. Rows of empty pews. A closed casket at the front, surrounded by white flowers that look gray in the desaturated palette. A few mourners, their faces pixelated into unrecognizable smears. The protagonist stands apart. Near the back, a well-dressed stranger watches - their form more defined than it should be, standing too still. Dreamlike and unsettling.

---

## ACT III: THE HAUNTED MONTHS

### Scene 13 - The Discovery: The Hidden Door [x]
**File:** `hidden_door.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A tapestry torn away from a hallway wall, revealing a seam in the wall - a door that shouldn't exist in a suburban house. The door is slightly ajar, warm stale air seeping through the crack as visible distortion. The door frame is older than the house, made of dark wood with carved symbols worn smooth by time. Beyond the crack: absolute blackness, but a blackness that feels alive. Analog horror aesthetic.

---

## ACT IV: THE DESCENT

### Scene 14 - The Spiral Stairs [x]
**File:** `spiral_stairs_down.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. Looking down into a stone spiral staircase that descends into darkness beneath a house. The walls are covered with the threshold symbol - a circle with a vertical line through it - carved and drawn hundreds of times. Some carved deep. Some drawn in something dark that could be ink or could be blood. The stairs seem to go down forever. The stone is ancient, worn smooth by countless feet. Liminal space atmosphere.

---

### Scene 15 - Level One: The Antechamber [x]
**File:** `antechamber.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. An underground stone chamber lit by a flashlight beam. Sleeping bags arranged in circles on the floor. Empty water bottles scattered. Journals and papers everywhere. This was a meeting place - a congregation point for a cult. The ceiling is low. The walls close. In the flashlight beam, dust motes hang frozen. An exit tunnel leads deeper, downward. Dreamlike and unsettling.

---

### Scene 17 - Level Two: The Residences [x]
**File:** `underground_residences.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. An underground tunnel carved into something like a neighborhood. Alcoves carved into the stone walls, some with beds, personal effects, photos pinned to stone. Abandoned but recently occupied. One alcove has a lantern still burning with impossible persistence. The beds are unmade. Someone was here. Someone might still be here, deeper in. Liminal space atmosphere.

---

### Scene 18 - The Photograph [x]

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A photograph pinned to a stone wall underground, illuminated by flashlight. The image shows robed figures standing in a group, smiling at the camera, faces pixelated. One of them has a recognizable posture - a missing sibling. Behind the group in the photo: a massive dark opening. A pit. The photo is the only proof they were ever here. Analog horror aesthetic.

---

### Scene 19 - Level Three: The Cathedral [x]
**File:** `underground_cathedral.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A vast underground cavern so large a flashlight can't reach the ceiling. In the center, a stone altar surrounded by thousands of melted candles, burned down to waxy pools. The space feels sacred and profane simultaneously. The altar surface is stained. On it rests an ancient book. The scale is overwhelming - this took centuries to create. Liminal space atmosphere.

---

### Scene 20 - The Ritual Book [x]
**File:** `rites_of_threshold.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. Close-up of an ancient handwritten book on a stone altar. The title page reads "THE RITES OF THRESHOLD" in careful calligraphy. Pages visible show diagrams of human figures descending, transforming, merging with something below. The ink is faded but the images are clear enough to disturb. Annotations in margins from different eras. Analog horror aesthetic.

---

### Scene 21 - The Pit [x]

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. Behind a stone altar in an underground cathedral, a hole in the floor. A pit descending into absolute darkness. The first rungs of an ancient iron ladder are visible, descending into the void. Warm air rises from below, visible as heat distortion. The darkness below isn't empty - it's full of something that absorbs light. The ladder goes down forever. Dreamlike and unsettling.

---

### Scene 22 - Level Four: The Warren [x]
**File:** `warren_tunnels.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A claustrophobic maze of narrow underground tunnels branching in every direction. The walls are wet, glistening in flashlight. The air is thick, warm, almost tropical. The ceiling is low enough to touch. Every direction looks the same. A hand is visible at the edge of frame, touching the wall to mark the path. Humming sound implied. Liminal space atmosphere.

---

## ACT V: THE REUNION

### Scene 23 - The Lowest Place [ ]
**File:** `lowest_place.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. An underground chamber unlike anything above. The floor is soft, organic, not stone. It seems to pulse. The warmth is oppressive. In the center of the chamber, a figure sits with their back to the camera. They're wearing familiar clothes - a missing sibling's clothes. They're perfectly still. The walls of this space seem to breathe. Dreamlike and deeply unsettling.

---

## ENDING SCREENS

### Ending A - Communion [x]
**File:** `ending_communion.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VH4S quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. Two figures standing together in organic darkness deep underground, holding hands, facing away from camera, walking deeper into a pulsing void. They're the same now. Together.

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A person bursting through a hidden door back into a suburban hallway, gasping, alive. Behind them, the door seals itself shut - the seam in the wall disappearing as if it was never there. They're safe. They survived. But in the corner of the frame, on the back of their neck, warm air is visible as heat distortion. Face obscured. Dreamlike and unsettling.

---

### Ending C - Defiance [x]
**File:** `ending_defiance.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A person climbing a ladder frantically, looking up toward dim light above. Below them, darkness is churning with something massive and displeased. A sibling's sad face is visible one last time in the darkness, not following, not fighting. Just watching them go. Face obscured by pixelation. Analog horror aesthetic.

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A person collapsed at the base of an underground ladder, alone. The chamber is empty - a sibling is gone, was perhaps never there. But a pendant with a circle-and-line symbol now hangs around the protagonist's neck, and in their eyes (visible through the pixelation) is something new: knowledge. Horror. And perhaps, impossibly, peace.

## GAMEPLAY SCENES (Additional)

### Office - Day [x]

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A cubicle farm under harsh fluorescent lights. Rows of identical desks stretch into pixelated infinity. A desk is visible in the foreground - a computer monitor glowing, a coffee cup going cold, a photo frame facing away from camera. Coworkers are blurred shapes in the background, faces obscured, indistinct and unimportant. The window shows gray daylight. Everything feels temporary, meaningless. Liminal space atmosphere.

The porch light casts a faint glow through the window. A figure is curled on a worn couch, wrapped in an old blue blanket, face obscured by pixelation but body language suggesting exhaustion. The TV murmurs in the corner, its cold blue light mixing with the warm lamplight. The room feels small, lived-in, domestic. Keys and a bag dropped by the door. A kitchen visible in the background, the faint suggestion of something reheated. This is home - but home carries weight. The warmth feels fragile, temporary. Liminal space atmosphere.

An upstairs hallway in a suburban house at night, dimly lit by a nightlight plugged into the wall. Bedroom doors are closed. The bathroom door is slightly ajar.

CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. An upstairs hallway in a suburban house with no lights at all. Only the faintest ambient light from somewhere - maybe moonlight through a bedroom door. The hallway stretches longer than it should. A water heater closet door at the end seems closer than before.

CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A suburban upstairs hallway after a hidden door has been sealed. The wall looks normal - too normal. No seam, no crack, no evidence anything was ever there. But the paint is slightly different where the door was. And if you look closely at the pixelation, there's a shape that might be a door. Might be nothing. The air is still warm. Analog horror aesthetic.

---

Dreamlike and unsettling.

CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A missing person's bedroom. The bed is made - someone else made it, after. Personal effects remain: books on the nightstand, photos on the wall (faces pixelated), medication bottles lined up neatly. A layer of dust is visible in the gray light. The room is preserved like a museum exhibit. Like a crime scene. Like they might come back. Liminal space atmosphere.

The medicine cabinet is open - pill bottles visible, labels unreadable. The shower curtain is pulled aside, revealing an empty tub. No one is here. The fear of finding them here was worse than the relief. The fluorescent light buzzes, flickers slightly. Water spots on the mirror distort reflections. Liminal space atmosphere.

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A small suburban backyard at night. A security light casts harsh shadows across dead grass. A fence marks the boundary - beyond it, other houses, their windows dark. A shed in the corner is padlocked. The back door of the house spills light onto the patio. You're looking for someone who isn't here. The yard feels bigger than it should, the darkness between the light sources absolute. Dreamlike and unsettling.

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. View through a car windshield at night. Headlights illuminate a dark road - suburban streets, houses with porch lights, stop signs. The dashboard glows dimly. Hands on the steering wheel, gripping too tight.

Institutional furniture, bad lighting, a desk between viewer and detective. Their face is sympathetic but pixelated beyond reading. Case files visible - missing persons, a name visible on a folder. A coffee cup. A notepad. The questions are routine. The answers aren't helping. The walls are that particular shade of government beige that makes time feel meaningless. Liminal space atmosphere.

CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A suburban house exterior on an overcast day. Everything is gray - the sky, the siding, the grass. No shadows because there's no sun. The porch light is off. The house looks tired, sagging. It's been three months since a disappearance. Grief has a color, and it's this gray. Liminal space atmosphere.

CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A bathroom or bedroom mirror. A person's reflection is visible - face obscured by pixelation, but body language clear. They're wearing a pendant with a circle-and-line symbol around their neck. Their hand touches it. The reflection seems slightly delayed, slightly wrong. The pendant's symbol is clearly visible. Wearing it felt right. That's what worries you. Dreamlike and unsettling.

---

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. A computer monitor in a dark room, the screen the only light source. Search results visible - occult symbols, ancient cults, "threshold" repeated in tabs. A face is reflected faintly in the screen, overlapping with the search results. The deeper you look, the more you find. The circle-and-line symbol appears in historical documents, in old photographs, in places it shouldn't be. Analog horror aesthetic.

---

### Alcove (Underground) [x]
**File:** `alcove.png`

Low-resolution pixelated horror game aesthetic, heavily dithered, limited color palette of muted browns, sickly greens, deep blacks, and desaturated reds. CRT scan lines visible, VHS quality with chromatic aberration at edges. PS1-era survival horror feel. One of the carved alcoves in underground residences beneath a house, lit by a single lantern with an impossible flame. A narrow bed with rumpled blankets. Personal effects: a book, a photo pinned to stone, a water bottle half-empty. Someone lived here, slept here, chose this over the world above. The lantern casts dancing shadows. It's been burning for longer than any lantern should. Liminal space atmosphere.

## NOTES FOR IMAGE GENERATION

1. **Color Palette Reference:**
   - Deep blacks (#0a0a0a)
   - Sickly greens (#3d4a2a, #4a5a3a)
   - Muted browns (#4a3a2a, #5a4a3a)
   - Desaturated reds (#5a3a3a, #6a4a4a)
   - Cold blues for TV light only (#3a4a5a)

2. **Consistent Elements:**
   - All human faces should be obscured/pixelated beyond recognition
   - The threshold symbol should appear subtly in backgrounds when possible
   - Warm air should always be suggested near the hidden door/below
   - Lighting should feel wrong - too harsh, too dim, or from impossible angles

3. **Technical Specifications:**
   - Generate at low resolution, then upscale with nearest-neighbor for pixel preservation
   - Add scan lines in post-processing
   - Apply chromatic aberration to edges
   - Consider VHS tracking distortion for key horror moments
