## [ ] 0. title.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Compose a 16-measure piece for the game's title screen—the player's first impression before entering the story. Key ambiguous (Dorian mode on D, allowing both hope and shadow), tempo 56 BPM. Begin with a single, distant piano note that decays into reverb, as if heard from the bottom of a well. Layer in an extremely low synthesizer drone that pulses slowly, like something breathing in its sleep far beneath the earth. Add sparse, high-register piano notes that descend chromatically—a lullaby heard through walls, familiar yet wrong. Include a faint melodic fragment that will later appear in "start.wav," but here it sounds distant, distorted, as if remembered rather than heard. The mood should evoke standing outside a house at night, knowing something has changed inside but not yet knowing what. This is the sound of ancient patience, of something that has waited millennia and can wait a few minutes more. Reference Angelo Badalamenti's "Twin Peaks" theme for that sense of beauty concealing darkness, filtered through the subsonic dread of Lustmord.

## [x] 1. office_ambient.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Compose a 16-measure ambient piece for a corporate office environment that feels subtly wrong. Key of D minor, tempo 72 BPM. Use soft Rhodes piano playing sparse, disconnected chords with long sustains. Add a barely-audible low synthesizer drone in the bass that wavers slightly off-pitch. Include occasional high-register piano notes that sound like distant phone notifications or keystrokes. The mood should evoke fluorescent lighting, cubicle walls, and the alienation of pretending to work while your mind is elsewhere. Think Erik Satie's "Gymnopédies" filtered through corporate muzak, with an undercurrent of melancholy. Avoid resolution—every phrase should feel suspended, unfinished, like a thought interrupted.

---

## [x] 2. start.wav
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Create an 8-measure piece capturing the bittersweet comfort of coming home at dusk. Key of A major with borrowed chords from A minor, tempo 66 BPM. Lead with a warm, slightly detuned upright piano playing a gentle, descending melodic motif. Layer in soft pad strings that swell and recede like breathing. The harmony should feel like a familiar blanket—comforting but worn thin. Include a subtle melodic phrase that hints at a lullaby but never quite resolves. This is the sound of a house that used to feel like safety, before something changed. Think Nils Frahm meets late-evening exhaustion—tender, tired, with the faintest shadow of something wrong in the lower registers.

---

## [x] 3. peaceful.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Write a 16-measure intimate nocturne for a scene of two people watching television in comfortable silence. Key of E-flat major, tempo 58 BPM. Feature a solo piano with soft attack, playing in the middle register with occasional gentle reaches into the treble. Add a warm, distant string pad that enters halfway through, like someone pulling a blanket closer. The melody should feel like the flickering glow of a TV screen in a dark room—soft blues and changing light. Include a brief moment of minor harmony in the second half that suggests the fragility of peace. This is the sound of borrowed time, of moments you'll only recognize as precious after they're gone. Reference Ryuichi Sakamoto's more delicate film work.

---

## [x] 4. quiet.wav
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Compose an 8-measure piece that sounds like the uncomfortable silence between two people who should be talking. Key of F-sharp minor, tempo 50 BPM. Use extremely sparse piano—single notes separated by long pauses, each one landing like a footstep in an empty hallway. No chord progressions, just isolated tones that suggest distance. Add a faint, low hum that could be a refrigerator or the house settling. The silence between notes should feel heavy with unspoken words. This is the sound of going to bed early instead of staying, of guilt too formless to name. Think Morton Feldman—notes as events, silence as the main character.

---

## [x] 5. uneasy.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Create a 16-measure piece for the moment you realize your home has become unfamiliar. Key of B-flat minor, tempo 70 BPM. Begin with a simple, domestic-sounding piano motif but introduce subtle wrongness—notes that arrive slightly early, intervals that feel off by microtones. Layer in a low synthesizer that pulses irregularly, like a heartbeat with arrhythmia. Add occasional high-pitched tones that could be incense smoke made audible. The harmony should suggest a space being claimed by something else—domestic chords invaded by tritones. This is the sound of coming home to find the furniture rearranged while you were gone. Reference Mica Levi's "Under the Skin" for that sense of familiar space becoming alien.

---

## [x] 6. tense.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Write a 16-measure piece for an argument that hasn't quite become an argument. Key of C minor, tempo 84 BPM. Use two melodic voices—piano and a mid-range synthesizer—that circle each other without harmonizing, like two people talking past each other. Build tension through rhythmic displacement: one voice slightly ahead, one slightly behind. Include moments where they almost sync, then diverge. Add a quiet, persistent pulse in the bass like a quickening heartbeat. No crescendo—the tension must sustain without release, like words caught in your throat. This is the friction of loving someone you can't reach. Reference Jonny Greenwood's "There Will Be Blood" score for that sense of human conflict stretched to breaking.

---

## [x] 7. tension.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Compose a 16-measure sustained dread piece for moments of psychological pressure. Key of E minor, tempo 76 BPM. Build on a foundation of tremolo strings at the edge of audibility, creating a bed of anxiety. Add a piano playing a simple three-note descending motif that repeats with subtle variations, like a thought you can't shake. Include low brass or cello drones that swell unpredictably. The piece should feel like standing before a door you know you have to open. Never resolve—every phrase should lead to another question. This is the weight of inevitable revelation, the paralysis before discovery. Reference the quieter moments of Penderecki filtered through modern ambient horror.

---

## [ ] 8. dread.wav
**Measures:** 32 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Create a 32-measure piece embodying ancient, patient wrongness. Key of D minor (but avoid clear tonality), tempo 54 BPM. Begin with an extremely low drone—almost subsonic—that establishes a sense of depth, of something vast beneath. Layer in sparse, high-register piano notes that fall like dust motes in abandoned space. Add reversed cymbal swells that never quite arrive. Include a recurring three-note motif (D, E-flat, D) that appears in different octaves like eyes opening and closing in the dark. The harmony should be ambiguous—neither major nor minor, just presence. This is the backbone of the horror: the feeling of being observed from inside your own walls, of realizing your house has always had something underneath it. Reference Lustmord's "Heresy" for that sense of prehistoric darkness made audible.

---

## [x] 9. somber.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Write a 16-measure piece for grief without closure. Key of G minor, tempo 62 BPM. Lead with a solo cello playing a melody that keeps searching for resolution and never finding it—phrases that ascend hopefully then fall back. Add piano chords that enter like memories: sudden, then fading. Include long silences between phrases, filled only by a faint room tone. The melody should evoke an empty casket, a funeral for someone who might still be alive. This is the particular sadness of ambiguous loss—mourning someone who is neither present nor confirmed gone. Reference Max Richter's "On the Nature of Daylight" but colder, more uncertain, as if the grief itself isn't sure what it's mourning.

---

## [x] 10. grief.wav
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Compose an 8-measure piece of raw, concentrated anguish for the moment of reading a loved one's final words. Key of A minor, tempo 48 BPM. Use a single voice—perhaps cello or muted piano—playing a melody that breaks apart as it progresses, notes becoming fragments, phrases dissolving into silence. Include a sustained high note that enters in the second half like a cry caught in the throat. No harmonic support—just the naked melody, alone. This should feel like the moment of understanding that you couldn't have saved them because they didn't want to be saved. Brief but devastating. Reference Arvo Pärt's "Spiegel im Spiegel" reduced to its most essential, painful core.

---

## [x] 11. emptiness.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Create a 16-measure piece for the hollow aftermath of loss. Key of F minor, tempo 56 BPM. Build on a foundation of white noise filtered to sound like static or distant rain—the texture of nothing. Add extremely sparse piano notes, one every few measures, each one echoing into silence. Include a faint, ghostly melody in the high strings that could be imagined—a memory of someone who used to be here. The piece should feel like walking through rooms that still hold the shape of absence. This is existing without living, going through motions in a house where someone used to be. Reference William Basinski's "Disintegration Loops"—the sound of presence slowly eroding into nothing.

---

## [ ] 12. horror.wav
**Measures:** 16 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Write a 16-measure piece for the moment the impossible becomes real. Key of B minor (with chromatic instability), tempo 80 BPM. Open with a sudden low strike—piano or tam-tam—that decays into silence. Then build with tremolo strings playing clusters of dissonant notes that writhe against each other. Add prepared piano sounds—muted strings, metallic resonance—that sound like breathing walls or doors that shouldn't exist. Include moments of sudden silence followed by unexpected high-register stabs. The rhythm should be irregular, organic, like the pulse of something alive where nothing should live. This is not jump-scare horror but cosmic wrongness—the violation of physical laws in your own home. Reference Krzysztof Penderecki's "Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima" made intimate and domestic.

---

## [x] 13. descent.wav
**Measures:** 32 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Compose a 32-measure piece embodying continuous downward movement. Start in D minor and gradually descend through the circle of fifths, ending ambiguously. Tempo begins at 66 BPM and gradually slows to 54 BPM by the end. Use a repeating bass figure that steps down chromatically throughout, like footsteps on ancient stone. Layer in muted brass playing long, sighing phrases that descend in canon. Add the sound of distant dripping water or stone echoes. Include a high, lonely melodic fragment that reappears at different depths like a fading memory of the surface. This is the journey into the earth—going deeper than architecture should allow, each step further from sunlight. Reference Gavin Bryars' "The Sinking of the Titanic" for that sense of inexorable descent into depths.

---

## [x] 14. awe.wav
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Create an 8-measure piece for moments of terrible beauty. Key of E-flat major but vast, almost atonal in its openness, tempo 50 BPM. Open with a sudden expansion—strings and synthesizer swelling into massive, reverberant space. The harmony should feel like cathedral heights in a place that has no sky. Include a simple, almost hymn-like melody played by a solo voice (horn or soprano synthesizer) that rises against the vastness. Add deep, resonant bass notes that suggest impossible scale. This is the sublime—terror and beauty merged, standing before something older than geology. Neither evil nor good, simply vast beyond comprehension. Reference Ligeti's "Lux Aeterna" with the awe of early Vangelis—cosmic wonder that terrifies.

---

## [x] 15. finale.wav
**Measures:** 32 | **Loop:** Yes

**Prompt:**
Write a 32-measure piece for the final confrontation between human and inhuman. Key of D minor resolving ambiguously, tempo 60 BPM. Combine elements from throughout the score: the domestic piano motif from "start" transformed into something ancient, the descending pattern from "descent" now stabilized, the drone from "dread" now almost warm. Add a new element—a simple, human melody that weaves through the darkness, representing love that persists across transformation. Include pulsing, organic rhythms like a heartbeat that isn't quite human. The piece should feel like everything converging: ancient patience reaching its conclusion, the weight of an impossible choice. Both terrifying and strangely tender. Reference Mica Levi's "Jackie" score for that sense of grief and grandeur intertwined.

---

## [x] 16. ending_a.wav ("Communion")
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Compose an 8-measure piece for surrender that feels like peace. Key of D major (arrived at from D minor), tempo 52 BPM. Begin with the darkness from "finale" but let it slowly warm, shift, open. Add a duet melody—two voices that were separate throughout the score now intertwining, becoming one. The harmony should feel like dissolution: chords that blur at the edges, notes that merge rather than resolve. Include a slow, expanding crescendo that suggests vastness embracing rather than consuming. This is horror as release, the relief of giving up the struggle. The particular tenderness of two people absorbed into oneness. Reference the ending of Górecki's Symphony No. 3, but gentler, more complete—pain transcended into something else entirely.

---

## [x] 17. ending_b.wav ("Escape")
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Create an 8-measure piece for hollow survival. Key of A minor, tempo 72 BPM (suggesting running, then slowing). Open with urgent, climbing figures—piano and strings reaching upward like climbing a ladder. Then abruptly thin to almost nothing: a single, tired piano playing fragments of the "start" melody, now damaged, incomplete. Add the faint suggestion of the drone from "dread" still present underneath—you escaped, but not entirely. End on an unresolved suspension. This is the exhaustion of surviving while leaving someone behind, safety that will never feel safe again. Reference the desolate endings of Tarkovsky films—survival without victory, the door closed but never truly locked.

---

## [ ] 18. ending_c.wav ("Defiance")
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Write an 8-measure piece for futile, beautiful resistance. Key of C minor with harsh dissonance, tempo 88 BPM then slowing dramatically. Begin with aggressive, clashing harmonies—the sound of something vast noticing you, pressing down. Add a single defiant melodic line (brass or cello) that keeps pushing upward against the weight. Include a moment of near-crushing dissonance, then sudden release as the weight withdraws. End with a single sustained note—marked, changed, but alive. Add a faint burning sound or metallic resonance suggesting the symbol burned into flesh. This is love as defiance against the impossible, the cost of trying to save what can't be saved. Reference Shostakovich's more brutal moments, softened by survival.

---

## [ ] 19. ending_d.wav ("Understanding")
**Measures:** 8 | **Loop:** No (plays once)

**Prompt:**
Compose an 8-measure piece for revelation that changes everything. Key ambiguous (modal, neither major nor minor), tempo 46 BPM. Open with a brief flash of the "awe" theme—cosmic scale—then immediately contract to intimate solo piano. The melody should feel like waking from a dream that was real, processing something too large for the mind to hold. Add a faint return of the domestic motifs from "start" and "peaceful," but now they sound different—still beautiful, but carrying weight they didn't before. End on a sustained, open chord that could go anywhere. This is the burden of understanding something humans weren't meant to comprehend. An ending that isn't really an ending—just the beginning of living with impossible knowledge. Reference the ambiguous codas of Toru Takemitsu—beauty that contains darkness, answers that raise more questions.

## Technical Notes

- All tracks should be composed in MIDI for flexibility in rendering with different soundfonts/virtual instruments
- Prioritize instruments: Piano, Strings (violin, viola, cello, bass), Synthesizer pads, Brass (muted), Prepared piano sounds
- Recommended BPM range: 46-88 (mostly slower tempos for horror atmosphere)
- Most tracks should loop seamlessly except endings and grief (one-shot)
- Leave headroom in arrangements for sound effects layering
- Consider slight detuning on key instruments to enhance unease
